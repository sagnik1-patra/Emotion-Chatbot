There is\\r\\ngenerally no lack of uncertainty, anxiety, fear, sadness, and anger. These are\\r\\nall normal emotions and being allowed to feel them is the beginning of the\\r\\nhealing process. It might be helpful to talk about these feeling with your fiancé,\\r\\na friend or a counselor.Now to get to your primary question.\\r\\nCan a relationship move past infidelity? The short answer is yes. A bit longer\\r\\nof an explanation is that is sounds like you and your fiancé had pieces of a solid\\r\\nfoundation to base a relationship on. For many couples they encounter a primary\\r\\nchallenge, sometimes that's money, or parenting and for some it's sexuality. If\\r\\nyou and your fiancé are both committed to balancing the positive aspects of your\\r\\nrelationship while improving the challenges than it's definitely possible to\\r\\nmove past this. This is not an easy process and for many couples takes months\\r\\nor years of healing while engaging in relationship counseling.\\xa0Good luck to you and your continues\\r\\nhealing and growth!\\n\"\n",
      " '\\n\\nI believe that counseling (and finding a GOOD therapist)\\r\\nwill be of significant help when the individual seeking therapy desires change,\\r\\nimprovement, and overall growth. Most counseling involves homework and a level\\r\\nof commitment outside of session that also contributes to resolution of\\r\\nproblems and an ability to cope with stresses in a productive way. Here are\\r\\nsome of the key ways that therapy can help. \\n1. Helps to define the problem and gain a clearer\\r\\nunderstanding of where it originates. Many people seek counseling because of symptoms they are\\r\\nexperiencing. These can include feeling sad, increased sleeping, substance use,\\r\\npanic attacks, self-harm, isolating one’s self, academic decline, etc. Often\\r\\ntimes, people are not aware of what is causing these symptoms. Having a\\r\\ntherapist to help guide and explore why the symptoms are occurring and where\\r\\nthey come from will give individuals increased insight and awareness into their\\r\\nproblems. \\n2. Allows for a safe outlet to vent.\\nNot everyone likes to share their problems with close\\r\\nfriends or family members. Maybe they don’t want others to know of their flaws.\\r\\nMaybe they don’t want to burden others with their problems. Or maybe they just\\r\\nare not comfortable talking about themselves. And in some situations people do\\r\\nnot have the option of talking with someone they know because they have no\\r\\nfriends or family. While talking with those we know can help bring some relief\\r\\nit is also nice to talk with someone like a therapist who is objective and\\r\\nemotionally removed from given situations. Counseling gives a safe outlet in\\r\\nwhich one can express their personal feelings and thoughts without feeling\\r\\njudged.\\n3. Counselors can offer various problem solving solutions.\\n\\nA good therapist usually will not directly point their\\r\\nclient in the direction they need to go. Counseling is about growth and\\r\\nteaching the client to identify triggers and use effective coping strategies\\r\\nthat will bring about emotional and psychological relief. Counselors will help\\r\\nclients to explore the various options available in given situation, based on\\r\\nthe client’s needs, wants, and values and will help them to choose the option\\r\\nthat best fits with their desired outcome. \\n4. Gives one the tools needed to cope with current and future\\r\\nproblems.\\nMany individuals that seek therapy have never learned\\r\\ngood coping strategies. Perhaps they did not have parents or caretakers to\\r\\nmodel productive ways to cope or maybe the symptoms they are suffering from are\\r\\noverbearing and take away the energy needed to cope. Different diagnoses\\r\\nrequire different tools; however some are beneficial for any problem and any\\r\\nindividual. These include but are not limited to relaxation techniques,\\r\\nbreathing exercises, development of healthy routines, using mindfulness,\\r\\nimproving communication skills, and recognizing and changing maladaptive\\r\\nthought patterns. A good counselor will teach clients how to use these tools,\\r\\nwill often practice them during session, and will assign homework for further\\r\\npractice and mastery of the skills.\\n\\xa0\\n'\n",
      " \"\\n\\nLet's just start with being real. Expressing\\r\\nyourself is vulnerable, and being vulnerable is hard. It takes courage and work\\r\\nto be vulnerable. My guess is that you have been shown in your lifetime that\\r\\nbeing vulnerable (ie, expressing yourself) is unsafe. My assumption would be\\r\\nyou have been criticized, or ignored when you have expressed yourself in the\\r\\npast, it has taught your emotional self to simply not do it again. This is a normal\\r\\nprotective mechanism that you have used to cope with past feelings of hurt. It\\r\\nwill take time and work to engage again in an emotional way.I would start my practicing and\\r\\nidentifying how you feel to yourself. Check in with yourself multiple times a\\r\\nday to gage where you are at emotionally. After you feel you have a good grasp\\r\\non this, start to engage in emotional conversations with others. Choose others that\\r\\nfeel safe to you, a good friend that knows you well, or a sibling or family\\r\\nmember. Expressing yourself is a behavior that you have suppressed out of\\r\\nprotection, so you can choose to engage in safe emotional expression behaviors\\r\\njust the same. Best of luck!\\n\"\n",

Our brains tend to replay scenes in our life that we wish had turned out differently or \\xa0in an effort to desensitize us to it. \\xa0If you are comfortable with it, you may want to consider sharing what you\\'re experiencing with your current partner so that he is able to understand what\\'s going on. Also, you may want to consider \\xa0what parts of your past relationship you blame yourself for. This can be a difficult task to undertake on your own, and the help of the therapist may be necessary to sort through the memories in a safe way. \\xa0Typically however, flashbacks and nightmares are a sign that the trauma \\xa0of what you went through needs to be addressed. \\xa0it\\'s a great thing that you were able to have the courage to get out of that relationship and you should be proud of yourself for that. \\xa0You may want to \\xa0begin therapy to address these traumatic memories and help you to sort through any conflicting emotions you have about it (i.e. \\xa0Feeling like it\\'s your fault for not recognizing the abuse or getting out of the relationship sooner, blaming yourself for being \\xa0\" The kind of person who gets into an abusive relationship \", \\xa0or believing that you somehow caused your ex to abuse you in some way.) \\xa0These types of beliefs and feelings can prevent us from moving past traumatic experiences and a trained therapist can certainly help you sort through them.\\xa0'\n",
